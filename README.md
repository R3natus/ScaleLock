This is my end of year project for Year 3 of Comp Sci at University.

It's an offline/portable password manager including:

- SHA256 Hashing
- .DB support
- Reliable and easy to understand GUI
- Windows Hello API support, e.g. Fingerprints/PIN
- Trustworthy encryption (No-one will be able to get your info except YOU!)
- A cute mascot

Made with .XAML/C# on Visual Studio. God bless.
